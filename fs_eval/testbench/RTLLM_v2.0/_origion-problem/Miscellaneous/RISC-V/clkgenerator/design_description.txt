Please act as a professional Verilog designer.

A clock generator module that produces a periodic clock signal, toggling its output state at regular intervals defined by the PERIOD parameter.

Module name:
    clkgenerator

Parameter:
    PERIOD = 10

Output ports:
    clk: The output clock signal generated by the module.

Implementation:
This module uses an initial block to set the initial state of the clock signal to 0. The clock toggles every half of the specified PERIOD, creating a square wave clock signal with the desired frequency.
