A Read-Only Memory (ROM) module designed for storing fixed data. This module provides a way to access predefined data based on an 8-bit address input.

Module name:
    ROM

Input ports:
    addr [7:0]: 8-bit address input used to select the data location in memory.

Output ports:
    dout [15:0]: 16-bit output that delivers the data stored in the ROM at the specified address.
Memory Array:
    reg [15:0] mem [0:255]: Defines a ROM with 256 locations, each 16 bits wide.
Initial Block:
    The initial block is used to pre-load the ROM with fixed data. In this example, memory locations 0 through 3 are initialized with specific values (16'hA0A0, 16'hB1B1, 16'hC2C2, 16'hD3D3). Other locations can be initialized as needed.
Behavior:
    The always @(*) block continuously outputs the data stored in the ROM at the memory location specified by addr.
Since ROM is read-only, this module includes only read operations.
