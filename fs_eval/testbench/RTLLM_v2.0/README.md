***Version 2.0***

We have released RTLLM v2.0 already, which builds upon **[v1.1](https://github.com/hkust-zhiyao/RTLLM/tree/v1.1)** by expanding the number of designs to **50**. 

Additionally, these designs have been meticulously categorized.
1. Added a design categorization file: ```File_list.md```.
3. Fix some bugs.

# RTLLM: An Open-Source Benchmark for Design RTL Generation with Large Language Model


Yao Lu, Shang Liu, Qijun Zhang, and Zhiyao Xie, "RTLLM: An Open-Source Benchmark for Design RTL Generation with Large Language Model," Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC) 2024.[[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.05345.pdf)

_**Note**: In our paper, the results are obtained based on RTLLM V1.0._

## 1. Documents

RTL Generation with Large Language Model Benchmark for generating design RTL with natural language (under construction). This repository contains a total of 29 designs. Each design has its own folder, which includes several files:

1. Design Description (**design_description.txt**):
    
    This file provides a natural language description of the design.

2. Testbench (**testbench.v**): 

    This file contains the testbench code used to simulate and test the design on Synopsys VCS.
   ```
   vcs testbench.v ../*.v
   ```

3. Designer RTL (**verified_verilog.v**): 
    
    This file contains the Verilog code that has been verified and confirmed to be functionally correct.

5. LLM Generated Verilog (**LLM_generated_verilog.v**): 
    
    This file contains the Verilog code generated by LLM. Just so you know, this code may not be verified and should be used with caution.

Please refer to the respective folders for each design to access the files mentioned above.

## 2. Run Makefile [^2]
[^2]: We have recently provided an automated Python script (auto_run.py) that you can use as a one-click compilation for all designs after simple modification.

You can run makefile to test the functionality of the code.

Step 1. Replace #DESIGN_NAME# with the design name you need to test.
```
TEST_DESIGN = #DESIGN_NAME#
```
Step 2. Compile the Verilog file.

```
make vcs
```
Step 3. Functionality test
```
make sim
```
Step 4. View the results
```
===========Your Design Passed===========
or
===========Error===========
or
===========Test completed with */N failures===========
```
Step 5. Clear output files
```
make clean
```

## 3. Workflow
  
**Fig.1** Complete RTL generation and evaluation workflow using this benchmark, including three straightforward stages.

- In stage 1, users feed each natural language description 𝓛 into their target LLM 𝓕, generating the design RTL 𝒱 = 𝓕(𝓛). If an LLM solution requires additional prompt techniques 𝓟, it will switch the natural language description 𝓛 to actual input prompts 𝓛𝓟, with the output design RTL being 𝒱 = 𝓕(𝓛𝓟). If necessary, additional human engineers' efforts can also be introduced, generating 𝒱 = ℍ(𝓕(𝓛𝓟)).

- In stage 2, the framework will test the functionality of the generated design RTL 𝒱 using our provided testbench 𝒯.

- In stage 3, the generated design RTL 𝒱 is synthesized into a netlist to analyze the design qualities regarding PPA values. They will be compared with the design qualities of the provided reference designs 𝒱ₕ.

---

- **Description** (_design_description.txt_) denoted as 𝒱: A natural language description of the target design's functionality. The criteria is, that a human designer can write a correct design RTL 𝒱 after reading the description 𝓛. This description 𝓛 also includes an explicit indication of the module name, all input and output (I/O) signals with signal name and width. These pre-defined modules and I/O signal information enable automatic functionality verification with our provided testbench.
- **Testbench** (_testbench.v_) denoted as 𝒯: A testbench with multiple test cases, each with input values and correct output values. The testbench corresponds to the pre-defined module name and I/O signals in 𝓛. It can be applied to verify the correctness of design functionality.
- **Correct Design** (_designer_RTL.v_) denoted as 𝒱ₕ: A reference design Verilog hand-crafted by human designers. By comparing with this reference design 𝒱ₕ, we can quantitatively evaluate the design qualities of the automatically generated design 𝒱. Also, these correct designs have all passed our proposed testbenches.

## 4. Experiments

**Fig.2** summarizes the quantitative evaluation of both syntax and functionality correctness of all five evaluated LLMs using RTLLM. 

- Syntax Correctness: Number of generated design RTLs 𝒱 with correct syntax, out of the five trials.
- Functionality Correctness: A success ✅ as long as there is one generated RTL successfully passing the testbench 𝒯, out of the ones already with correct syntax.

**Fig.3** summarizes the design qualities of generated design RTL from different LLMs[^3]. These quality values are measured on each post-synthesis netlist. We report the worst negative slack (WNS) as the timing metric. It also presents the qualities of our designer-generated reference design 𝒱ₕ in RTLLM. All these reference designs are functionally correct.

[^3]: The worst LLM StarCoder is not presented due to space limitations.

## RTLLM-2.0
Shang Liu, Yao Lu, Wenji Fang, Mengming Li, and Zhiyao Xie, "OpenLLM-RTL: Open Dataset and Benchmark for LLM-Aided Design RTL Generation(Invited)", IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD), 2024.[[paper]](https://zhiyaoxie.com/files/ICCAD24_OpenLLM.pdf)

The benchmark RTLLM-2.0 dataset is meticulously categorized into
four primary module classes: Arithmetic Modules, Memory Modules,
Control Modules, and Miscellaneous Modules. Each class encompasses
a variety of functional units pertinent to diverse computational
and control tasks, as delineated in **Fig.4**.
