Please act as a professional Verilog designer.

Module name: 
    up_down_counter

Function:
    A 16-bit counter that can increment or decrement based on control signals.

Input ports:
    clk: Clock signal (1-bit), used to synchronize the counting process.
    reset: Reset signal (1-bit), used to reset the counter to zero.
    up_down: Control signal (1-bit), determines the counting direction. 
             If up_down = 1, the counter increments; if up_down = 0, it decrements.

Output ports:
    count [15:0]: 16-bit output representing the current counter value.

Implementation:
    The module uses a synchronous process triggered by the rising edge of the clock signal (`clk`).
    If the reset signal (`reset`) is active, the counter resets to zero.
    If the `up_down` control signal is high, the counter increments on each clock cycle.
    If the `up_down` control signal is low, the counter decrements on each clock cycle.
    The `count` output reflects the current value of the counter, which can range from 0 to 65535.
