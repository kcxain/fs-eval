Implement a module of a 3-bit comparator for comparing binary numbers.

Module name:  
    comparator_3bit               
Input ports:
    A [2:0]: First 3-bit input operand (the first binary number to compare).
    B [2:0]: Second 3-bit input operand (the second binary number to compare).
Output ports:
    A_greater: 1-bit output indicating if A is greater than B.
    A_equal: 1-bit output indicating if A is equal to B.
    A_less: 1-bit output indicating if A is less than B.

Implementation:
Comparison Logic: The module compares the two 3-bit binary numbers A and B using combinational logic.
- The outputs A_greater, A_equal, and A_less are determined based on the comparison of A and B.
- A_greater is set to 1 if A > B, A_equal is set to 1 if A == B, and A_less is set to 1 if A < B.

Output Encoding: The outputs are mutually exclusive, meaning only one of the three outputs will be high (1) at any given time, based on the comparison results.
