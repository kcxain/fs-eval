So simple\nthat we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the\nLemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left\n(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch\ndirections if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped\non the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's\nbumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.\nIf it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch\ndirections.\n\nIn addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,\nwhen ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say \"\"aaah!\"\". When the ground\nreappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same\ndirection as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect\nthe walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground\ndisappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while\nstill falling, also does not affect the walking direction.\n\nIn addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do\nuseful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig\nif it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will\ncontinue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that\npoint, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue\nwalking in its original direction once it hits ground again. As with\nfalling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig\nwhen falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a\nwalking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of\nthese conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig,\nwhich has higher precedence than switching directions.)\n\nAlthough Lemmings can walk, fall, and dig, Lemmings aren't invulnerable.\nIf a Lemming falls for too long then hits the ground, it can splatter. In\nparticular, if a Lemming falls for more than 20 clock cycles then hits\nthe ground, it will splatter and cease walking, falling, or digging (all\n4 outputs become 0), forever (Or until the FSM gets reset). There is no\nupper limit on how far a Lemming can fall before hitting the ground.\nLemmings only splatter when hitting the ground; they do not splatter in\nmid-air.\n\nImplement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is\npositive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk\nleft.\n\nAssume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the\nclock.\n\nEnclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].

This\nFSM acts as an arbiter circuit, which controls access to some type of\nresource by three requesting devices. Each device makes its request for\nthe resource by setting a signal _r[i]_ = 1, where _r[i]_ is either\n_r[0]_, _r[1]_, or _r[2]_. Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, and\nrepresents one of the three devices. The FSM stays in state _A_ as long\nas there are no requests. When one or more request occurs, then the FSM\ndecides which device receives a grant to use the resource and changes to\na state that sets that device's _g[i]_ signal to 1. Each _g[i]_ is an\noutput from the FSM. There is a priority system, in that device 0 has a\nhigher priority than device 1, and device 2 has the lowest priority.\nHence, for example, device 2 will only receive a grant if it is the only\ndevice making a request when the FSM is in state _A_. Once a device, _i_,\nis given a grant by the FSM, that device continues to receive the grant\nas long as its request, _r[i]_ = 1.\n\nImplement a module that represents this FSM. Use separate always blocks\nfor the state table and the state flip-flops, as done in lectures.\nDescribe the FSM outputs, _g[i]_, using either continuous assignment\nstatement(s) or an always block (at your discretion). Assign any state\ncodes that you wish to use. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on\nthe positive edge of the clock.\n\nEnclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].

This index\naccesses a 128-entry table of two-bit saturating counters. The branch\npredictor should contain a 7-bit global branch history register. The\nbranch predictor has two sets of interfaces: One for doing predictions\nand one for doing training. The prediction interface is used in the\nprocessor's Fetch stage to ask the branch predictor for branch direction\npredictions for the instructions being fetched. Once these branches\nproceed down the pipeline and are executed, the true outcomes of the\nbranches become known. The branch predictor is then trained using the\nactual branch direction outcomes.\n\nWhen a branch prediction is requested (predict_valid = 1) for a given pc,\nthe branch predictor produces the predicted branch direction and state of\nthe branch history register used to make the prediction. The branch\nhistory register is then updated (at the next positive clock edge) for\nthe predicted branch.\n\nWhen training for a branch is requested (train_valid = 1), the branch\npredictor is told the pc and branch history register value for the branch\nthat is being trained, as well as the actual branch outcome and whether\nthe branch was a misprediction (needing a pipeline flush). Update the\npattern history table (PHT) to train the branch predictor to predict this\nbranch more accurately next time. In addition, if the branch being\ntrained is mispredicted, also recover the branch history register to the\nstate immediately after the mispredicting branch completes execution.\n\nIf training for a misprediction and a prediction (for a different,\nyounger instruction) occurs in the same cycle, both operations will want\nto modify the branch history register. When this happens, training takes\nprecedence, because the branch being predicted will be discarded anyway.\nIf training and prediction of the same PHT entry happen at the same time,\nthe prediction sees the PHT state before training because training only\nmodifies the PHT at the next positive clock edge. The following timing\ndiagram shows the timing when training and predicting PHT entry 0 at the\nsame time. The training request at cycle 4 changes the PHT entry state in\ncycle 5, but the prediction request in cycle 4 outputs the PHT state at\ncycle 4, without considering the effect of the training request in cycle\n4.
